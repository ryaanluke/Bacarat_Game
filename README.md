# Bacarat_Game
Full Bacarat Card game in SystemVerilog
#### Rules

- Two cards are dealt to both the player and the dealer (i.e., the banker) face up (first card to the player, second card to dealer, third card to the player, fourth card to the dealer).
- The score of each hand is computed as described under _Score_ below.
- If the player’s or banker’s hand has a score of 8 or 9, the game is over (this is called a “natural”) and whoever has the higher score wins (if the scores are the same, it is a tie)
- Otherwise, if the player’s score from his/her first two cards was 0 to 5:
  - the player gets a third card
  - the banker may get a third card depending on the following rule:
    1. If the banker’s score from the first two cards is 7, the banker does not take another card
    1. If the banker’s score from the first two cards is 6, the banker gets a third card if the face value of the player’s third card was a 6 or 7
	1. If the banker’s score from the first two cards is 5, the banker gets a third card if the face value of the player’s third card was 4, 5, 6, or 7
    1. If the banker’s score from the first two cards is 4, the banker gets a third card if the face value of player’s third card was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7
    1. If the banker’s score from the first two cards is 3, the banker gets a third card if the face value of player’s third card was anything but an 8
	1. If the banker’s score from the first two cards is 0, 1, or 2, the banker gets a third card.
- Otherwise, if the player’s score from his/her first two cards was 6 or 7:
  - the player does _not_ get a third card
  - if the banker’s score from his/her first two cards was 0 to 5:
    - the banker gets a third card
  - otherwise the banker does not get a third card
- The game is over. Scores are computed as below. Whoever has the higher score wins, or if they are the same, it is a tie.

#### Score

The score of each hand is computed as follows:

- The value of each card in each hand is determined. Each Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 has a value equal the face value (eg. Ace has value of 1, 2 is a value of 2, 3 has a value of 3, etc.). Tens, Jacks, Queens, and Kings have a value of 0.
- The score for each hand (which can contain up to three cards) is then computed by summing the values of each card in the hand, and the rightmost digit (in base 10) of the sum is the score of the hand. In other words, if Value1 to Value 3 are the values of Card 1 to 3, then

  Score of hand = (Value1 + Value2 + Value3) mod 10

  If the hand has only two cards, then Value3 is 0. You should be able to see that the score of a hand is always in the range [0,9].

It is interesting to note that in this version of the game, all moves are automatic (the player does not have to make any decisions!). The version played in Monte Carlo is slightly different, in that a player can choose whether or not to take a third card. We will not consider that here.
